// receipt-shape — pure mapping from (raw verdict × enforcing mode × what came
// back) to the governance receipt's `outcome` / `approval.status` / `observe_mode`.
//
// The guard is the enforcing layer, so it — not the server — is authoritative
// for the mode a decision was acted under. The "mode of record" rule keeps three
// facts separate and never merges them:
//
//   policy.decision  — what policy SAID   (allow / approval_required / deny)
//   result.outcome   — what HAPPENED      (allowed / blocked / denied_by_reviewer / …)
//   observe_mode     — the reason the two can differ
//
// PENDING IS CONDITIONAL. `approval.status: "pending"` is a claim that a human
// decision is still outstanding, and it is the only status that belongs in the
// dashboard's approval queue. So it is emitted in exactly one situation: an
// approve verdict with nothing back yet. Everything else carries a terminal
// status:
//
//   * the human answered          → approved / denied
//   * policy honoured a host bypass → bypassed (nobody was asked)
//   * observe mode                → not_required (nothing was gated, so nobody
//                                   was ever asked — see below)
//
// Emitting "pending" for a gate that has already been answered is what parked
// every approved action in the queue forever.
//
// OBSERVE MODE records without gating: the action runs whatever the verdict was.
// It therefore reports what happened, and `not_required` — because no human was
// asked and none is waiting. The alternative, a uniform "pending" flagged with
// observe_mode, is only kept out of the queue by a downstream
// `approval_status = 'pending' AND observe_mode = false` filter; one consumer
// reading approval_status alone re-creates the very bug this module fixes. A
// status that cannot be mistaken for an outstanding decision is excluded by
// construction instead.
//
// Pure and dependency-free, so it unit-tests without booting the daemon.
